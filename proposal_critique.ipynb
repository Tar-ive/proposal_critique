Summary: The ultimate goal of this Phase II application is to develop novel small molecule, broad-spectrum therapeutics against viral infections caused by filoviruses, arenaviruses, and other viruses that depend on the PPxY L -domain motif for egress and spread of infection. Some of these viruses, including Ebola (EBOV), Marburg (MARV), and Lassa fever (LAFV) viruses, are highly pathogenic and classified as Category A bioterror pathogens. We and others hav e determined that efficient budding of these emerging human pathogens depends on the subversion of host proteins, such as neural precursor cell expressed developmentally down-regulated protein 4 (Nedd4), by PPxY L-domains in the matrix proteins of these RNA viruses. The identification and development of small molecule inhibitors that interfere with these virus-host interactions should effectively block virus egress, disease progression, and transmission. In these efforts we have discovered several chemical series of small molecule inhibitors of the host Nedd4virus PPxY complex important for viral egress which led to one analog possessing proof of concept in vivo activity in a Marburg virus challenged mouse model. As FDA approved therapeutic agents for the treatment of these most of these viral infections are not available, our identification of virus -host inhibitors that may prevent virus spread will fill a significant unmet need. Moreover, these inhibitors will be broad-spectrum, and therefore will likely be effective against newly emerging viruses as well as viral variants. As described below, we will use a rigorous multifaceted approach to identify, develop, and validate PPxY budding inhibitors identified in Phase I as potent, broad-spectrum antivirals. The goal of this Phase II STTR grant application is to optimize our lead inhibitors of VP40 PPxY -Nedd4 interactions to generate full - fledged predevelopment drug candidates ready for IND directed studies. This will be accomplishe d by combining the pharmaceutical and medicinal chemistry expertise of the scientists at the Fox Chase Chemical Diversity Center, Inc. (FCCDC) with the expertise and experience in the experimental aspects of antiviral therapy of the Harty Lab at the University of Pennsylvania. We will realize this goal by optimizing our existing series of inhibitors, exemplified by in vivo active FC -10696, for improved potency and oral drug properties (Aim 1), evaluating new compounds based on two potent series for their ability to specifically inhibit PPxY -Nedd4 interactions and subsequent VLP and surrogate virus egress (Aim 2), identifying compounds having suitable drug properties and selectivity using in vitro and in vivo ADMET evaluation (Aim 3), and evaluating compounds for their antiviral efficacy against authentic BSL-4 viruses in vitro and in vivo (A im 4). Project SummaryAbstract Page 7 Contact PDPI: Harty, Ronald N. Narrative : There is an urgent need to develop antiviral therapy against emerging human RNA viruses that represent potential agents of bioterrorism (Ebola, Marburg, and Lassa fever). We have discovered small molecule compounds that disrupt budding and spread of live viruses; a process that is critical for virus dissemination and disease progression. Here, the Harty group at the University of Pennsylvania, experts in the antiviral technology of this proposal, have partnered with the small business Fox Chase Chemical Diversity Center, Inc. to further develop these broad spectrum antiviral budding inhibitors by using medicinal chemistry, live virus budding assays, and live cell imaging techniques.

FACILITIES AND OTHER RESOURCES Texas Biomedical Research Institute EN VIRONMENT: Texas Biomedical Research Institute (Texas Biomed) was founded as a private, not-for - profit research institution in 1941 by Thomas B. Slick Jr., with a goal to unravel the mysteries of disease through innovative thinking, creative problem solving, and cutting edge technologies. Located on a 200-acre campus on the northwest side of San Antonio, Texas, our scientists work each and every day to improve human health by being a world leader in infectious disease research. Texas Biomed partners with hundreds of researchers and institutions, targeting advances in the fight against infectious diseases impacting our communities around the world, including AIDS, TB, hepatitis, malaria, hemorrhagic fever viruses, parasitic infections and many other infectious diseases. We also study co-morbidities of infection and vulnerable populations, such as the very young and the elderly and those suffering from cardiovascular diseases and metabolic disorders. Texas Biomed is staffed by more than 350 employees including a multidisciplinary team of approximately 65 doctoral -level scientists  physiologists, geneticists, virologists, immunologists, molecular biologists, cell biologists, physicians and veterinarians  who lead more than 200 major research projects. Texas Biomed also supports 150 technical staff and an administrative support staff of more than 100 professionals. Texas Biomed recently underwent a strategic planning process and defined its focus as an institute that studies infectious diseases and conditions that make an individual susceptible to infectious diseases (aging, metabolic syndrome, etc.). The Institute developed three new programmatic areas: Host-Pathogen Interactions is the study of the basic biology of infection in humans and animals  the immediate i ntersection of host and pathogen. Disease Intervention  Prevention is the development of diagnostics, treatments and vaccines to reduce the severity ofor cure infection. Population Health is the identification of correlates of disease susceptibility or resistance to infectious diseases on a population level. Each program has two faculty leads who focus on the academic development of the programs and their themes. Administrative responsibilities are supported through the Office of the Vice President for Research, unencumbering scientists to pursue the academic mission of Texas Biomed. Texas Biomed supports a culture of learning and development. The Institute holds a weekly seminar that hosts an external guest approximately monthly, and internal presentations from faculty and trainees at all other times. Attendance at seminar ranges between 50 and 80 faculty and research staff. Administrative staff are also frequently in attendance to learn about the latest research at Texas Biomed. Texas Biomed supports a monthly journal club that rotates across the three programmatic areas that typically has an attendance of 20-40 researchers. Individual laboratories also hold their own journal clubs, frequently shared across multiple scientific groups. The Vice President for Research runs a monthly training course for Staff Scientists on how to manage a laboratory, and a monthly training course for a subset of Staff Scientists on how to write a grant. Staff Scientists at Texas Biomed are the equivalent of Research Faculty. Human Resources provide training through a Lunch  Learn lecture series and individualized training programs on management and leadership. Communication at Texas Biomed is facilitated by a monthly institute-wide newsletter and video blogs. Texas Biomed is part of a city wide, 4-institute collaborative (with University of Texas Health Science Center, University of Texas San Antonio, and Southwest Research Institute) that works synergistically to increase the biomedical reputation of the city of San Antonio. Initiatives include the San Antonio Vaccine Development Center and the Precision Therapeutics Program, which are supported by and foster collaboration across the four institutions. Administrative collaboration includes negotiated rates for use of each institutions cores, participation in graduate and training programs, and input on faculty search committees including consideration for dual hire appointments. RESEARCH FACILITI ES: Our faculty and staff scientists conduct their research amid 550,000 square feet (sq. ft.) of space that includes laboratories and core facilities, offices, auditorium, animal hospital, library, and animal facilities, including a six-acre corral. Research laboratories are spaced across three main buildings for a total of 55,361 sq. ft. of space. Facilities  Other Resources Page 11 Contact PDPI: Harty, Ronald N.

Personal Statement The overall goal of my research on negative-sense RNA viruses is to understand how these viruses assemble and bud from cells, and how host protein recruitment and virus -host interactions contribute to these late stages of virus replication. My current research program is focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms of filovirus (Ebola and Marburg viruses) and arenavirus (Lassa fever) assemblybudding, so that we can identify broad-spectrum inhibitors of virus-host interactions and validate their efficacy in blocking virus budding. Indeed, through a highly collaborative and productive effort in partnership with Dr. Jay Wrobels team at Fox Chase Chemical Diversity Center, and Dr. Olena Shtanko at the BSL-4 laboratory at Texas Biomedical Research Institute, we have identified lead candidate budding inhibitors with potential broad-spectrum activity. In Phase 2, we will rapidly advance and develop these lead candidate therapeutics for NIAID Category A pathogens toward clinical trials. Overall, my expertise, experience, and demonstrated record of successful and productive research in the areas of RNA virus-host interactions and virus egresstransmission has prepared me to lead the proposed collaborative experiments described in this proposal. 1.

Contributions to Science 1. Viral L-domainhost interactions regulate virus egress and spread . Viruses have developed unique and complex molecular mechanisms to ensure efficient egress of mature virions from infected cells. I focused my early studies on unraveling the intricate roles of both viral and host proteins in this process, and particularly the specific recruitment of host factors to promote efficient budding of infectious virus. A better understanding of these virus- host interactions and the mechanisms of virus budding not only will provide fundamental insights into the functions of both viral and host proteins, but also will lead to the emergence of novel strategies to inhibit virion egress and spread. The Late (L) budding domain motifs (PTAP andor PPxY) are highly conserved in the matrix proteins of a wide array of RNA viruses (e.g. filoviruses, arenaviruses, rhabdoviruses, paramyxoviruses, henipaviruses, and retroviruses) and represent attractive and novel targets for the development of therapeutics having broad -spectrum antiviral activity. My lab was first to demonstrate that the Ebola virus VP40 protein plays a central and sufficient role in virion assembly and egress, due in part to the presence of overlapping PTAP and PPEY L-domains. We went on to show that independent expression of VP40 led to the production and egress of virus -like partic les (VLPs) that accurately mimic budding of live infectious virus. We used VP40 VLPs and genetically engineered VSV recombinants that expressed WT and mutant L-domain motifs from Ebola virus VP40, to show that budding is dependent on viral L-domain mediated recruitment of host proteins associated with the ESCRT pathway (Tsg101 and Nedd4) for complete virus -cell fission or separation. Most recently, we have identified for the first time a third functional L-domain motif (YPx (n)L) within Ebola virus VP40 that serves as an alternative L-domain motif to enhance VP40 VLP release by recruiting and interacting with host ESCRT - associated protein Alix. a.

Identification and development of host-oriented L-domain inhibitors of virus budding. Based in part on our steady progress in elucidating the molecular aspects and host involvement in virus budding from studies described above, and our long-term goal of developing antivirals, a current major effort in my lab is to identify, develop, and optimize small molecule compounds targeting viral L-domainhost interactions to inhibit virus egress and spread. We postulate that for viruses such as Ebolavirus, administration of such an antiviral therapeutic during an outbreak would inhibit virus dissemination and sprea d in infected individuals, thus slowing disease progression and allowing the individuals immune system time to mount a robust response to effectively combat and clear the infection. Indeed, there is a vital need for the advancement and development of effective and safe therapeutics against emerging, high priority pathogens such as Ebola, Marburg, Lassa fever, and Junín viruses, and since these virus -host interactions represent a common mechanism in a range of emerging RNA viruses, we predict that they represent an Achilles heel in the life cycle of these RNA virus pathogens. Toward this end, we have ongoing, fruitful collaborations with pharmacologists and virologists at the BSL-4 labs at USAMRIID and with medicinal chemists at Fox Chase Chemical Diversity Center, which has led to the identification of two successful lead series of PTAP and PPxY budding inhibitors that exhibit on-target, broad - spectrum antiviral activity against a wide array of RNA viruses. Specifically, we demonstrated that our current lead PTAP inhibitor, compound 0013, blocked egress of both Ebola and Junín VLPs at nanomolar concentrations, and our current lead PPxY inhibitors, compounds 4 and 5, blocked egress of Ebola, Marburg, and Lassa fever VLPs. Most exciting were our findings that these compounds could also block budding of live infectious viruses, including VSV and Junín (Harty lab), rabies (in collaboration with Dr. M. Schnell, TJU), Ebola (Kikwit) and Marburg (Ci67) (in collaboration with Drs. Andrew Herbert and J. Dye, USAMRIID, unpublished data). Currently, we are using Structure Activity Relationship (SAR) in collaboration with medicinal chemists Drs. J. Wrobel and A. Reitz (FCCDC) to identify analogs with enhanced potency and low cytotoxicity, as we seek to further transition one or more full-qualified L-domain inhibitors into more detailed IND-directed pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and toxicity studies. a.

In non-excitable cells, Ca 2 signals are generated and maintained through a tightly regulated process termed store-operated Ca2 signaling. As ER Ca2 levels decrease, Ca2 dissociates from C -terminal EF hands of the ER membrane -resident protein Stromal Interaction Molecule 1 (STIM1). Ca2 dissociation from STIM1 initiates its oligomerization and localization to ER regions Biosketches Page 28 Conta ct PDPI: Harty, Ronald N. adjacent to the plasma membrane where it interacts with and activates Orai1 Ca2 channels that control extracellular Ca2 influx. While previous studies in my lab implicated Ca2 broadly in control of Ebola VP40 VLP formation, we have now demonstrated for the first time that filovirus VP40 and arenavirus Z matrix proteins trigger host cell Ca 2 signals by activating the ER Ca2 sensing protein STIM1, which then activates plasma membrane Orai1 (Ca2) channels. Furthermore, we demonstrated that VP40 control of VLP production critically depends upon Orai1 -mediated Ca2 entry, as suppressing the expression or inhibiting the function of STIM1 and Orai1, or pharmacologically inhibiting Ca2 permeation of Orai with selective channel blockers profoundly inhibits production of VLPs. Importantly, we also established that Orai1 mediated Ca2 signals regulate transmission and spread of infectious Ebola, Marburg, Lassa fever, and Junín viruses in collaboration with John Dyes group at USAMRIID. Together these results have broad and profound significance because of 1) the insight they provide into mechanisms that control virus egress and transmission, 2 ) their establishment of STIM1 and Orai1 as conserved, essential, and immutable host proteins that underlie Ca2 signals critical for enveloped RNA virus egress, and 3) their validation of Orai blockers as the first of a family of broad-spectrum, host-oriented anti -viral therapeutics. Our ongoing research is focused on 1) defining the mechanism of virus induced calcium signaling, 2) defining the role of calcium in both host and virus dependent steps of budding, and 3 ) pursuing the development of small molecule inhibitors of the Orai1 channel as a host- oriented therapeutic approach to block egress of a wide-array of RNA viruses. a.

Innate immune defenses of hemorrhagic fever virus infection. Innate immune responses to virus infection provide a critical first line of defense for the host against the invading pathogen. Understanding the complex interplay between the host innate immune defense mechanisms and counteraction by the filoviruses is crucial for developing novel antiviral strategies, vaccines, and therapeutics. We have been interested in the host innate immune response to filoviruses and have investigated several mechanisms of host innate immune mediated defenses involving host proteins TLR4, SOCS1, SOCS3, and ISG15. ISG15 is an interferon stimulated gene that has garnered much attention recently due to its broad-range of antiviral activity against a plethora of pathogens including DNA and RNA viruses. We demonstrated for the first time that ISG15 inhibited budding of EBOV VP40 VLPs in a PPxY L-domain dependent manner, and that such inhibition involved impairment of host Nedd4 ligase activity. We continue to investigate whether ISGylation of additional VP40 host interactors ( e.g. IQGAP1) can adversely affect VP40 function in budding. In addition, we are interrogating the effect of ISG15 expression on inhibition of Junín virus assembly and budding in vitro and in vivo using ISG15 -- mice (in collaboration with Dr. A. Garcia -Sastre, MSSM). These studies will reveal new host innate immune defense mechanisms that may regulate the budding processes of several high priority NIAID Category A pathogens. Moreover, this information will be critical to identify strategies (therapies andor vaccines) designed to tip the scale in favor of the host in the battle between viral pathogens and host innate immune defenses. a.

I have 34 years of experience in pharmaceutical industry focused on medicinal chemistry and drug design on a variety of drug discovery programs. In my current position at Fox Chase Chemical Diversity Center (FCCDC), I am involved in creation, leadership and management of medicinal chemistry and drug discovery partnerships with academic and biotech researchers to advance chemical hits to viable preclinical drug candidates up to and including the IND stage. I was formerly Senior Director of Medicinal Chemistry at WyethPfizer in Collegeville, PA where I mentored and guided the efforts of up to 31 medicinal chemists, and worked successfully with outside alliance partners in the design and synthesis of novel agents for multiple drug discovery programs (hit to Preclinical Development). I was directly involved in bringing forward nine development track candidates (Phase 0 and beyond). My hands -on expertise in research includes project and portfolio management, hit triage, hit-to-lead and lead optimization from hits found using enabling technologies such as high-throughput screening, fragment based drug discovery, and virtual screening. In these efforts I have employed ligand and structure based SAR methods, analytical chemistry, multi -step synthesis, parallel synthesis, data management. I obtain and use ADME and PK data in the design of our analogs. I have become involved with Prof. Harty on evaluation of egress inhibitors (namely mammalian Nedd4  viral L domain inhibitors) of RNA viruses as an approach toward new antiviral drugs to combat Ebola, Marburg, Lassa and AIDS. In this capacity I have provided Prof. Harty with medicinal chemistry leadership on a Phase I STTR grant application and along with my colleagues at FCCDC have discovered new egress inhibitor leads that are more potent, stable and suitable for composition of matter patent status than what we (FCCDC and Harty lab) discovered prior to the STTR -funded work (see Journal of Virology , 2014, 88(13), 7294-7306). We have since published an SAR account of our further work (Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2016 26(15), 3429-35). We have obtained an issued U.S. patent on the initial series and have make great advances during the Phase I STTR period of study resulting in in vivo proof of concept efficacy in a mouse model of Marburg infection. I also have additional experience with infectious diseases including antiviral small molecules therapeutics (Nef inhibitors -HIV) and antibacterial agents against drug resistant pathogens. My role in this project would be to implement and oversee all aspects of the medicinal chemistry program including design of analogs (with participation of the bench chemists), day to day and long term management of medicinal chemists, directing all ADME, PK and drug safety studies with advice from our CRO partners. We will use a project flow scheme I devised to find the best compounds and I will also be involved in any major project decisions with PI Ron Harty.

Personal Statement I am interested in understanding how filoviruses and other emerging viruses establish productive infection and trigger disease in affected individuals. My thesis research focused on the mechanisms of budding and incorporation of virus nucleocapsids into nascent virions of Mopeia virus, a close relative of Lassa Fever virus. As a Postdoctoral Scientist, I studied mechanisms of entry and replication of highly pathogenic viruses as well as developed and tested novel therapeutics to combat these pathogens. My work has identified cell factors critical for Ebola virus and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus entry into cells. Since advancing to the Staff Scientist position, I have established my own laboratory to study mechanisms of pathogenesis and dissemination of filoviruses and other high-containment pathogens. I have also extensively collaborated with a number of investigators, including Dr. Harty, to coordinate and perform virus studies to identify host factors critical for replication and spread of filoviruses as well as test novel antiviral therapeutics using a mouse model of Ebola and Marburg virus disease. I provide sophisticated molecular biology and cell biology techniques for studies of highly pathogenic viruses. I am well -trained in BSL4 procedures and have been working in Texas Biomeds ABSL4 laboratory since 2011. I will be responsible for all BSL4 studies as well as virus data analysis. B.

Contributions to Science Characterization of mechanisms of assembly, egress, and spread of emerging virusesUnderstanding how viruses invade and establish productive infection in host cells is essential to identify novel therapeutics and to reveal how the cell itself functions. My work on assembly of Mopeia virus, a close relative of Lassa Fever virus, has revealed that ALIXAIP1, which is required for the biogenesis of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) of the cell, binds to and drives incorporation of virus nucleocapsids into nascent virions. Recently, in collaboration with Dr. Ronald Harty, I have helped to identify angiomotin (Amot), a key regulator of YAP nuclearcytoplasmic localization and function, as essential for egress and spread of authentic Marburg and Ebola viruses. 1.

PMCID: PMC7307192. Identification of host factors critical for entry and replication of high-containment viruses My work on Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever virus spearheaded the identification of the MVB as the site of release of viral genome into the cell cytoplasm. Since disruption of this compartment completely abolishes infection, I have been working on identifying compounds that interfere with MVB function. My research on EBOV has led to the finding that proteins that are known to initiate and coordinate autophagy, a catabolic process where cellular membranes serve as a source of vesicles whose role is to engulf cell contents for degradation, were also essential for macropinocytosis, a primary route of virus uptake. Interestingly, these cellular proteins appear to coordinate macropinosome formation close to the cell surface, an unexpected finding since these proteins were thought to function exclusively internally. I have been involved in several collaborative projects dedicated to mapping cellular networks critical for virus replication. For one such study, in collaboration with Dr. Schlesinger, I have developed assays to manipulate clinically relevant primary human cells to demonstrate the novel finding that E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase RBBP6 binds components of EBOV polymerase complex to modulate virus transcription and replication. 1.

Macrophage signaling pathways to control acute infection In collaboration with Dr. Wendy Maury, I investigated how acute infection with Plasmodium parasite, a causative agent of malaria, affected EBOV challenge in a BALBc mouse model of virus disease. The work demonstrated that acute Plasmodium infection protected the animals from lethal viral challenge and that such protection was dependent on parasite-elicited IFN -γ and associated macrophage signaling events. In addition to elucidating a factor critical for the outcome of EBOV disease in malaria-virus coinfected populations, the study carefully analyzed what virus challenge dose was appropriate for research on EBOV pathogenesis. Inoculation of mice with either 1, 10, or 100 PFU resulted in uniform lethality and similar virus loads in blood and major tissues. Interestingly, the protective effect of acute parasitemia was apparent only in 1 PFU -inoculated animals, demonstrating the critical need for appropriate experimental set up. In a separate study, I co-investigated the mechanisms of tissue macrophage-mediated control of acute virus infections. The study identified a previously unappreciated role for macrophage-intrinsic CD40 signaling in controlling EBOV infection. 1.

PERSONAL STATEMENT I have 11 years of computational chemistry experience with 17 peer reviewed publications. My background includes extensive experience in computer -aided drug design with a specialty focus on computational fragment-based methods. In 2010, I joined BioLeap, a small business that specializes in protein-protein interactions and that has a proprietary fragment-based computational chemistry software platform. I participated in the development of novel inhibitors for DHFR, PCSK9, 11β -HSD, and recA. During that time, I integrated molecular dynamics and docking software into BioLeaps proprietary fragment-based discovery platform. From 2013 to 2014, I was the project leader for BioLeaps PCSK9 program, which consisted of modeling (BioLeap), assays (Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard), and chemical synthesis (WuXi and BioDuro). As Director of Computational Chemistry at FCCDC, I apply structural biology to SAR diversification efforts in areas of innovative pharmacology. For example, I work closely with Dr. Wrobel and his team on multiple projects currently. I will apply my knowledge and expertise in the area of pharmacophore development to achieves the potency, efficacy and ADME gains of this grant application targeting the host Nedd4:virus PPxY interaction for the treatment of Marburg, Ebola and related diseases.

C. CONTRIBUTIONS TO SCIENCE 1. My vision is to create better drugs by rigorous molecular design. Fragment-based lead discovery (FBLD) involves constructing drugs from small chemical building blocks (fragments) that bind to a protein target. Numerous companies, such as Abbott, Astex, and others, are pursuing this strategy by screening fragment libraries, followed by X-ray crystallography or NMR. In contrast, my research starts with a detailed hypothesis of what protein binding interactions are required of a drug for inhibition or activation. Commercial and proprietary design tools, some of which I created, are then used to search ligand- protein or fragment-protein simulation data for poses, ranked by predicted binding affinity, which can be assembled or optimized into custom compounds that satisfy the requirements. The designed compounds are synthesized and tested in assays. With success, this establishes a predictive model to guide subsequent lead optimization. This is a protein-centric strategy, complementary to ligand -centric SAR approaches. This methodology provides access to broad chemical diversity, which is crucial for solving difficult problems in lead identification and optimization.

The field of foldamer design promises new routes to important compounds for use in sensors, smart materials, therapeutics and catalysts. The term foldamer refers to a molecule that folds into a structurally stable state in solution. Proteins and peptides are an important class of natural foldamers that carry out a host of essential functions in biology, including molecular recognition, information storage, catalysis, and controlled crystallization of inorganic materials. The desire to mimic such functions with synthetic molecules inspires the field of foldamer design. I developed cyclic β-peptides as stochastic sensing elements and as a model chiral system for studying surface interactions. Other work included a universal method for restraining short peptides in helical conformations by a main-chain hydrogen bond surrogate (HBS) approach. These HBS peptides inhibited a variety of pharmaceutically relevant protein-protein interactions and the resulting technology was licensed by Aileron Therapeutics for clinical development.

My postdoctoral fellowship and subsequent two year federal employment was in The Molecular Interfaces and Tribology Section of the Department of Chemistry, Naval Research Laboratory. This section studies interdisciplinary questions in basic and applied interface and surface science. Our groups research stretched from advancing broad analytical methods, such as vibrational circular dichroism, to evaluating both prototypical and realistic interfaces to crafting and improving molecular surfaces and peptide architectures for applications such as controlling biological activity, anti -fouling, or lowering contact friction. One focus area was in the design and employment of bioinspired materials that conserve and utilize the exceptional characteristics of biomaterials while combining added functionality, such as fluorescence or conductivity, not originating from natural materials.

The beginning of my computational chemistry career began when I was using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to determine the structures of biological macromolecules like peptides, polypeptides, and proteins. To do this, I would rely on 1D, homo- and hetero-nuclear 2D, and triple resonance, 3D, spectra. Some other examples of this work are cited in scientific contribution 3, above. After extracting all available information about the atomic distances and torsion angles from the NMR spectra, computer -aided structure calculations would convert distance and torsion angle data (constraints) into the 3D atomic model. For these calculations, a molecular dynamics simulation was used with simulated annealing; increasing temperature to generate an ensemble of conformations then decreasing temperature with increasing constraints based on the NMR data. The result is a family of structures that span a relatively narrow conformational space (low RMSD), unless intrinsically flexible, and obeys the constraint cri teria.

Justification for budget above statutory budget limitations According to National Institutes of Health SBA -Approved SBIRSTTR Topics for Awards over Statutory Budget Limitations as listed in Appendix A of the omnibus 2020 solicitation (https:sbir.nih.govsitesdefaultfilesNIH_Topics_for_Budget_Waivers.pdf), the topic discovery and development of therapeutics for infectious diseases (the prime concern of this proposal) is listed in NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Disease (DMD) as eligible for budgets over the statutory maximum amounts. Small molecule drug discovery is very expensive and labor intensive, involving the synthesis and evaluation of a large number of test compounds in an iterative fashion. In this STTR Phase II grant application, we embark on a full lead optimization program with the goal of obtaining preclinical drug candidates for the treatment of Marburg, Ebola and related viral infections. Our current lead series are novel and suitable for composition of matter patent protection, and a US patent has issued on the original series which will be supplemented by additional provisional patent applications over time. We expect the optimized compounds at the end of Phase II to have increased potency, and be safe and suitable for oral administration.

Commercialization Plan We have developed small molecule leads that impede the progression and transmission of RNA viruses including Marburg and Ebola viruses, both potential bioterrorism agents and an area of focus for National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) small business funding. In addition, other viruses that may be therapeutic targets of our agents include Lassa and Human T Cell Leukemia virus. A therapeutic agent arising from our efforts will be taken orally alone or in combination with other agents by persons infected with these RNA viruses, or taken as prophylactic agents for individuals deemed to be in high risk situations such as military or healthcare workers. Our current lead candidate FC-10696 was shown to be a potent inhibitor of virus budding (egress) and transmission in vitro and is active in vivo (mouse). Its mechanism is novel (inhibition of the viral matrix protein interaction with mammalian target cell proteins). In this Phase II STTR application we plan to fully characterize preclinical candidates suitable for IND enabling toxicology studies. We present here our Commercialization Plan from our joint program of study with researchers at University of Pennsylvania and the Texas Biomedical Research Institute, covering the topics listed in the guidelines for STTR submissions. A significant portion of this report was taken from a proprietary Technology Niche Analysis supported by the NIH and prepared for FCCDC by Bruce Inwood of Foresight Science and Technology. 1. Value of the STTR Project, Expected Outcomes and Impact. We review here our key technology objectives for this STTR, commercial need for our technology, our competitive advantage relative to standard of care, and the impact of this technology upon drug discovery and society as a whole. 1.1 Key technology objectives, therapeutic benefit, commercial need and competitive advantage relative to current standard of care of the STTR project. Marburg and Ebola viruses cause hemorrhagic diseases that afflict humans and nonhuman primates. Our proposed drug candidate will be a novel small molecule oral agent used alone or in conjunction with other antiviral agents for individuals infected with filoviruses Marburg and Ebola or other RNA viruses, including arenaviruses (Lassa), which can cause severe hemorrhagic fever syndromes in humans with high mortality rates, or rhabdoviruses (Rabies). Viral hemorrhagic fevers (Ebola, Lassa fever, etc.) are a focus for NIAID SBIRSTTR research and funding (Omnibus Solicitation for SBIRs and STTRs, PHS 2020-, p. 34). These viruses depend on an interaction between their matrix protein PPxY motif and select host proteins for efficient virus egress and spread of infection. Thus, drugs that block or disrupt viral -host interactions required for virus budding are expected to effectively block virus transmission and disease progression. The 2014-2015 outbreak of Ebola in western Africa resulted in over 28,000 infected individuals and over 11,000 deaths (WHO: Ebola Situation Report 2015). More recently the Democratic Republic of the Congo has second largest Ebola epidemic on record, which is ongoing, and as of June, 2020, with more than 2,200 lives lost, 3,400 confirmed infections and 1,160 survivors since the outbreak was declared on 1 August 2018. These unprecedented epidemics have spurred a call to action to discover new, cost effect therapies that combat this deadly pathogen. Among these efforts are several vaccines and antiviral drug candidates. However, the current vaccines are not a complete defense since they must be given pre-exposure. Oral antiviral agents used alone or in combination may be of value for individuals who respond adversely to the vaccine, and could be of value as prophylactic agents for individuals deemed to be in high risk situations such as military or healthcare workers. Therefore, effective therapeutics are needed to safeguard the largely immunologically naive human population by providing immediate protection. We have discovered two novel series of small molecule early leads that have nanomolar potency at inhibiting RNA virus budding and are Commercialization Plan Page 123 Contact PDPI: Harty, Ronald N. effective at reducing spread of live viruses including Marburg and Ebola virus. We are currently pursuing both series in order to increase our chance of success. Our most advanced lead is compound, FC -10696 and close structural analogs have the following attributes, tested to the extent afforded by the Phase I level of funding:  Potent activity (IC 50  100 nM) in the Marburg and Ebola VLP cellular budding (egress) assays,  Evidence that analogs of FC -10696 directly target the host cell and virus molecular machinery that effect viral cellular egress,  Live virus activity against RNA viruses (Marburg, Ebola),  Metabolic stability in mouse and human liver microsomes,  No cytochrome P450 3A4 activity which translates to a lower risk of drug- drug interactions,  Good drug levels upon IP administration in mice, and  Proof of concept in vivo reductions of Marburg virus (IP administration) in mouse models. However, it is important to note that improved analogs and additional novel composition of matter are expected to be discovered during the course of the Phase II STTR period of study, with fully characterized ADME properties suitable as antiviral oral drug candidates for preclinical development. 1.2 Expected outcomes: path to commercialization including timelines. The goal of this STTR Phase II application is to produce one or more preclinical drug candidates by medicinal chemistry synthesis optimization strategies that would be ready for GMP scale up and IND enabling studies. At the end of this award period we would have one or more drug candidates that are:  Potent, orally available inhibitors of RNA virus egress, due to inhibition of the viral matrix protein PPxY interaction with cellular Nedd4,  Broad spectrum activity agains t RNA viruses (Ebola, Marburg, Ebola, Lassa, RSV, etc).  Are not cytotoxic at concentrations 20-fold or higher than the live virus assay IC50,  Have suitable ADME and PK properties in mice for once a day oral administration,  Have oral activity in a mouse antiviral assay,  Have little or no cytochrome P450 inhibitory (Cyp) activity against the seven Cyp isoforms most likely to cause exposure variability and drug- drug interactions (DDIs),  Have little or no activity in a manual patch clamp assay to assess hERG (human Ether-à-go-go-Related Gene product), suggesting a greatly lower risk of the compound causing cardiac arrhythmias,  Have little or no activity in an Ames testing with and without metabolic activation, suggesting a greatly lower risk of the compound being mutagenic,  Have chemical syntheses that are efficient and scalable, and  Provide the basis for one or more composition of matter U.S. patent applications. We anticipate being in an ideal position to pursue IND enabling studies with our candidate compound and will require additional funding to support IND filing and early clinical development. Many of the future IND -enabling activities would be funded from sources listed later in this application. Such post -Phase II SBIR activities include:  Preparation of 300 g of non-GMP active pharmaceutical agent,  Selection of a suitable salt form (if necessary), vehicle and formulation, and evaluation of crystallinity and the propensity for polymorph formation,  Analytical methods development,  Drug substance stability testing, including standard pharmaceutics development work -up involving shelf- life and stress testing,  File additional provisional and PCT patent applications as necessary, and  Prepare 5 kg of GMP quality active pharmaceutical ingredient. Commercialization Plan Page 124 Contact PDPI: Harty, Ronald N. With the completion of GMP and non-GMP batches we plan to initiate the necessary studies to support an IND filing, specifically investigation of metabolites, in vitro toxicity and acute in vivo safety pharmacology and toxicity assessment. Activities include:  Metabolite ID (human, rat and monkey), characterization for toxicity and biological testing,  Full PK parameters in three relevant safety pharmacology species, mice, rabbit, and non-human primate (NHP), chosen since they are used in relevant in vivo pharmacology studies,  Investigation of Cyp450 inhibition and induction and transporter modulation in detail, for the potential for unexpected drug-drug interactions,  Enhanced survival in two or more GLP double blind placebo -controlled animal models of Ebola according to the Animal Rule of Efficacy (some of these studies might be done during the IND phase). Viral load and survival will also be assessed,  Completion of in vitro GLP toxicology (hERG, Ames, genotoxicity),  Conducting dose ranging and 28-day safety profiles in mice and NHPs,  Safety Pharmacology: Cardiovascular safety study in dogs, CNS safety in rats, respiratory safety in rats (if needed),  Reproductive toxicology in mice and rabbits (possibly do afterduring Phase I studies).  Conducting a pre-IND meeting with the FDA to establish and understand expectations, and  Initiating preparation of an IND to facilitate the transition into clinical evaluation. We have established a world-class PPxY Project Leadership Team (PPLT) to interpret data and provide strategic direction on a real time basis. The PPLT will regularly provide advice and guidance (at least monthly) in person, by Zoom, or by email. The PPLT will interpret data most appropriately and coordinate experimental design in close coordination with the Harty group and FCCDC management.

Patrick has authored 98 papersreviewsbook chapters and is an inventor on 36 patentspatent applications. He has presented 110 invited seminars worl dwide. Assuming that our candidate has progressed to IND status, our next objective will be clinical evaluation. Collectively, the management of FCCDC has been responsible for more than a dozen compounds that have entered human clinical trials, with one currently in Phase III and two in Phase II. Based on this experience, we propose the following path to commercialization with the associated timelines.  A pre-IND meeting will be held with the FDA prior to initiation of IND enabling studies, to obtain guidance as to proper preclinical and clinical study design and requirements. We expect to file an Investigational New Drug (IND) in 2Q2024, with First in Human (FIH) dosing to begin 1Q2025. If we have partnered with an appropriate mid-level or major pharmaceutical company, then our development partner will monitor and lead the drug development process.  Since our primary indication is as a Marburg antiviral medication, effectiveness of our candidate may not easily be determined in human clinical trials for ethical reasons, particularly if there is not an outbreak of the virus. Thus, we will resort to the Animal Rule (21CFR Part 314 Subpart 1) as the regulatory pathway for approval of this drug.  Initial Phase I clinical evaluation will take place in normal individuals looking for safety and tolerability in a single ascending and multiple ascending dose format and drug-drug interactions. Clinical read-outs will include standard hemodynamic parameters involved in cardiovascular safety testing. Adverse events would be monitored. The study would most likely take 12 months, enroll 40 participants and cost $3 million.  Phase II trial beginning 1Q2027 will be an intervention trial for healthy patients with human T cell leukemia virus, (a virus with a similar mode of egress to Marburg). A dose of candidate compound would be administered orally with a placebo. The endpoints would be change in viral load. The study would most likely take 10 months, enroll 140 participants and cost $10 million.  A New Drug Application (NDA) will be filed with the U.S. FDA containing all of the CMC and other ICH regulatory and safety pharmacology documentation required for commercialization. This would be schedule to occur at 2Q2029.  Initial FDA approval would be for use as an antiviral therapeutic agent for Marburg infection. This would occur on or about 1Q2030. The Target Product Profile for our candidate is shown in Table 1. Table 1. Desired Product Profile Preferred Minimally acceptable Efficacy ( survive) 95 85 Efficacy (virus) Undetectable levels of virus Undetectable levels of virus Adverse events Comparable to placebo Minor Administration Oral Oral Dosing schedule Once daily Twice a day Drug resistance None None Stability No special packaging required Modest precautions acceptable  An IV formulation may be preferable for the extremely ill, and a liquid formulation useful for children Commercialization Plan Page 127 Contact PDPI: Harty, Ronald N. 1.3. Impact on drug discovery and society . In the outbreak of a terrorist exposure to Marburg, Ebola or related virus, thousands if not greater numbers of people could die before vaccines become available to treat the affected population. Our technology, an oral antiviral medicine for Ebola, Marburg, Lassa and other deadly viruses, could be used alone or with other antiviral medications to protect unvaccinated individuals for the time required to mount an immune response to the vaccine. These agents may also be of value for individuals who respond adversely to the vaccine, and could be of value as prophylactic agents for individuals deemed to be in high risk situations such as military or healthcare workers. In addition, our agent may be effective against the related human T cell leukemia virus that can lead to a rare but highly aggressive cancer. This agent also has the potential to be used as an HIV medication used in conjunction with other HIV antiviral agents. Since current HIV medications can have reduced efficacy over time due to resistance mechanisms, other agents used in combination can reduce resistance and side effects, new drugs are of great need. Finally, our agents that block Nedd4 activity, such as FC -10696, have the potential to show clinical effectiveness against other areas of medical need including various cancers, and obesity (Huang, 2019, Li, 2015; Wan, 2019, Ye, 2014; Zou, 2015). Continued successful prosecution of this project will allow Fox Chase Chemical Diversity Center to benefit financially and be able to expand and hire additional staff, thereby creating jobs. In addition, the development, clinical validation and commercial exploitation of this platform technology will serve as a great testament to the value of the SBIRSTTR program. In summary, patients will be treated with an effective and safe therapy that had not been available before, Fox Chase Chemical Diversity Center and partners will realize potentially substantial financial return, and the STTR program will have served its mission to society. 2. Company Fox Chase Chemical Diversity Center, Inc., (FCCDC, www.fc -cdci.com) founded in 2008, is an emerging biotechnology company located in Doylestown, PA whose mission is to advance basic scientific discoveries by providing value-added early drug discovery and medicinal chemistry research support for the translation of viable preclinical drug and diagnostic candidates prior to eventual entry into human clinical trials. Our goal is to partner with suitable biomedical research collaborators on selected projects or act as their companys proprietary medicinal chemistry research service. We bring a unique and highly experienced team of internal scientists and collaborative external partners in order to leverage cutting edge scientific advances. The staff at FCCDC has vast drug discovery experience, drawing from a diverse background of pharmaceutical and biotech companies including Johnson  Johnson, Wyeth and Merck. FCCDC has two fully functional, multisite medicinal chemistry laboratories with two 300-MHz NMRs, multiple LCMS machines, microwave reactor, and multiple Gilson semi - prep HPLCs for compound and library purification. We have prepared 12,000 new chemical entities (NCEs) so far, with two compounds advancing into human clinical trials, both funded initially by SBIR grant support. FCCDC has a 30,000 member onsite chemical inventory of reagents and starting materials for ready use, which are bar-coded, computer searchable, and segregated according to chemical class. As the basis for our internal technology platform, we have the ability to empower research programs at multiple stages of their development: provide insight into probe molecule identification and synthesis, in silico identification of custom and commercial high throughput screening libraries, perform hit triage, hit to lead medicinal chemistry, and lead optimization. Importantly, we also prepare or assist in preparation of intellectual property documents. We seek to improve efficiencies in early drug discovery by quickly derisking the overall process using modern methods and wisdom regarding drug suitability and compound library evaluation. 3.Market, Customers and Competition 3.1 Market. In response to credible scenarios of bioterrorist attacks using a filovirus or other infectious agents, the US Congress enacted Project BioShield legislation that was signed in 2004 which provided $5.6 billion over 10 years to encourage the private sector to develop medical countermeasures against chemical, biological and other terrorism agents (Grotton, 2011). Following this legislation, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) was created two years later to oversee BioShields advanced development and procurement efforts. In 2013 Congress renewed laws to extend funding by passing the Pandemic All Hazards Commercialization Plan Page 128 Contact PDPI: Harty, Ronald N. Preparedness Reauthorization Act that provided an additional $2.8 billion and extended BARDA until 2018 (Genome Web Daily News, 2013). As an example, the US has granted Fast Track designation to the Arbutus Ebola drug and has funded $140 million for RD on EVD (PR Newswire 2014). BioCryst was awarded $12 million for development of BCX4430 (Barda 2015). In addition to the Barda program, the commercial market for future natural outbreaks is growing at a CAGR of 95.2 and the market is expected to reach $56 million by 2020 (Allied Market Research 2015). Lassa fever is another viral disease treatable with our egress inhibitors . This malady is caused by the Lassa virus and results in 300,000 to 500,000 cases annually, mainly in western Africa and causes about 5,000 deaths each year ( Ogbua 2007) . Transmission of Lassa virus to humans occurs most commonly through ingestion or inhalation due to rodent infestation. A drug in this category could also be effective against human T cell leukemia virus (HTLV), which can lead to adult T-cell leukemialymphoma (ATLL). ATLL is a rare and fast-growing T-cell lymphoma that can be found in the blood (leukemia), lymph nodes (lymphoma), skin, or multiple areas of the body (Lymphoma Research Foundation, 2015). Around 20 million people worldwide are infected with HTLV. It is common in Japan, South and Central America, the Caribbean and Western Africa, and a large percentage (30) of African Americans are infected in certain areas of the US (e.g. New Jersey and New Orleans). It is transmitted through sexual contact or exposure to infected blood and blood products. Only a small percentage of carriers (5) actually come down with ATLL however, but there is no way to predict those that do. Survival depends on the ATLL subtype and var ies from 4-6 months to more than five years (Gonçalves, 2010). Treatment options include standard anti -cancer protocols but at present no therapy targets the virus. Other diseases and disorders from HTLV include the incapacitating neurological disease (HTL V-associated myelopathytropical spastic paraparesis HAMTSP), uveitis, rheumatic syndromes, and predisposition to helminth and bacterial infections (Gonçalves, 2010). As mentioned earlier, the compounds in this application may block other biological functions of Nedd4. For example, Nedd4 is overexpressed in a variety of cancers including bladder, breast, prostate, gastric carcinomas, colorectal, breast and non-small cell lung carcinomas and inhibits several tumor suppressor systems (e.g. PTEN, Beclin). Suppression of Nedd4 has been shown to reduce tumor cell growth (Boase, 2015; Wan, 2019, Ye, 2014; Zou 2015). Thus, these compounds could find applications in the treatment of such cancers. Nedd4 also negatively regulates interferon (IFN) -induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) that restricts cellular infection by influenza virus. Therefore, blocking Nedd4 could lead to therapeutic treatment of influenza (Chesarino, 2015) 3.2 Customers. As mentioned previously, BARDA is the most obvious customer for our RNA virus antiviral agent; however several potential governmental partners could provide development funds andor resources toward development including the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Office of Biodefens e Research (OBRA), Department of Defense (DOD), The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), The United Sates Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), Defense Science and Technology Laboratories (DSTL), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In addition to pursuing the government funding options outlined above, we may seek to partner with small biotechnology companies such as Siga, Tekmira, Chimerix, MappBio Pharm, Athene, Biocryst and Tetraphase, and large companies such as Merck, Johnson  Johnson, and GSK who currently are developing one or more therapeutics targeting a bioterrorism threat as most of these companies have a stated company goal of identifying and developing additional therapeutics in this area. 3.3 Competition. Since there are currently no other agents that inhibit virus egress that are being developed as broad spectrum RNA antiviral agents, an oral drug product based on FC -10696 is potentially a first-in -class treatment either as a mono-therapeutic prophylactic agent, or in combination with other agents currently in development for treatment of RNA viral infections. With respect to Ebola efforts, presently there are several therapeutics agents being evaluated that are summarized here. Commercialization Plan Page 129 Contact PDPI: Harty, Ronald N.  Recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus Zaire Ebola virus (rVSV-ZEBOV), sold under the brand name Ervebo (Merck) is a vaccine that prevents Zaire-strain Ebola. When used in ring vaccination, Ervebo has shown a high level of protection. Around half the people given the vaccine have mild to moderate adverse effects that include headache, fatigue, and muscle pain. Ervebo does not protect against other species of Ebolavirus or Marburg virus. Also, rural distribution has been a challenge and there is no data on longevity of the vaccines protection and how often an additional dose boost is required to extend immunity.  Johnson and Johnson is developing a vaccine regiment that consists of two doses leveraging different vaccines. One is the Ad26.ZEBOV monovalent vaccine based on adenovirus type 26 (Ad26) vector expressing the glycoprotein (GP) of the Ebola virus Mayinga variant (Ad26.ZEBOV). The other is multivalent Modified Vaccinia Virus Ankara (MVA) strain containing ZEBOV, SEBOV, Marburg Virus GP and Tai Forest nucleoprotein inserts (MVA-BN -Filo). More than 6,500 individuals have now participated in clinical studies for the Ebola vaccine across the U.S., Europe, and Africa. So far, the data from these studies suggest that the vaccine stimulates a robust immune response and has a favorable safety profile. Janssen has also assembled a stockpile of 1.5 million vaccine regimens for potential use in public health emergencies.  ZMapp (MappBio USA) is a cocktail of three monoclonal antibodies with neutralizing activity against Ebola virus in animal models. Phase II trial is underway. A similar produce MIL-77 (MabWorks, China) is undergoing Phase I study. A trial conducted in 71 patients, 36 of whom received ZMapp in addition to the standard of care, did not show a significant effect on mortality. At 28 days, death had occurred in 84 of 169 (49.7) of patients in the ZMapp group.  REGN-EB3 (Regeneron) is an experimental biopharmaceutical antiviral drug that is a cocktail of three monoclonal antibodies (REGN3470, 3471 and 3479) for treatment of Ebola virus disease. It is being developed, tested and manufactured as part of an agreement established in 2015 with BARDA, part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. REGN -EB3 is currently under clinical development and its safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority. It was developed against the Zaire species of Ebola virus, but the Sudan and Bundibugyo strains have also caused outbreaks and it is unlikely that EB3 would be effective against these strains. It was tested in the PALM trial that had enrolled nearly 700 participants across four Ebola Treatment Centers in the DRC. At 28 days, death occurred in 52 of 155 (33.5) patients in the REGN-EB3 group.  mAb114 is a monoclonal antibody (Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP) that is being evaluated as a treatment for Ebola virus disease. A license for mAb114 was obtained by in 2018 from the National Institutes of Health - National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. In the PALM trial that had enrolled nearly 700 participants across four Ebola Treatment Centers in the DRC. At 28 days, death occurred in 61 of 174 (35.1) patients in the MAb114 group.  Galidesivir (BCX4430, BioCryst) is a broad-spectrum small molecule antiviral in advanced development under the Animal Rule for the treatment of viruses including Ebola, Marburg, Yellow Fever and Zika viruses. A Phase 1 clinical safety and pharmacokinetics study in healthy subjects has been completed, and in animal studies, galidesivir has demonstrated survival benefits. Galidesivir is a viral RNA -dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor that has also demonstrated broad-spectrum activity in vitro against more than 20 ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses in nine different families, including filoviruses, togaviruses, bunyaviruses, arenaviruses, paramyxoviruses, coronaviruses and flaviviruses. Galidesivir may be suitable for administration by intravenous, intramuscular, and oral routes. There remains a critical need for additional agents, particularly with alternative modes of action. First many of the therapeutic agents above, particularly among the vaccine, antibody, siRNA andor antisense oligonucleotides are specific for individual viruses and sometimes only one or more strains within a virus. Biological agents require iv or infusion administration, and also need to be kept in the cold during storage, which are not ideal conditions in many remote areas of virus prevalence. Our product would be broad spectrum for RNA viruse s that have PPxY motifs. Our product differentiates further from vaccines in that it would be an oral agent with a great probability of more economic manufacturing and ease of distribution. Our agent could be Commercialization Plan Page 130 Contact PDPI: Harty, Ronald N. used in conjunction with other oral agents, like the cocktail approach to HIV drug administration, as synergistic therapeutic effects and a decrease in the risk of drug resistance are possible. 4. Intellectual Property Protection FCCDC and the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania obtained U.S. Patent 10,160,756, December 25, 2018. This application contains composition of matter and use claims specific to earlier analogs of FC -10696. FC-10696 and its present suite of analogs are outside the scope of this patent and will be subject to new composition of matter applications. We will seek to create additional value in this project by the continued prosecution of the other U.S. provisional patent applications and those that would be expected to emerge in the future. We will file PCT applications and pursue patent protection in major foreign markets, including in Europe, Asia and the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China).

As an example, the US has granted Fast Track designation to the Arbutus Ebola drug and has funded $140 million for RD on EVD (PR Newswire 2014). BioCryst was awarded $12 million for development of BCX4430 (Barda 2015). In addition to the Barda program, the commercial market for future natural outbreaks is growing at a CAGR of 95.2 and the market is expected to reach $56 million by 2020 (Allied Market Research 2015). Lassa fever is another viral disease treatable with our egress inhibitors . This malady is caused by the Lassa virus and results in 300,000 to 500,000 cases annually, mainly in western Africa and causes about 5,000 deaths each year ( Ogbua 2007) . Transmission of Lassa virus to humans occurs most commonly through ingestion or inhalation due to rodent infestation. A drug in this category could also be effective against human T cell leukemia virus (HTLV), which can lead to adult T-cell leukemialymphoma (ATLL). ATLL is a rare and fast-growing T-cell lymphoma that can be found in the blood (leukemia), lymph nodes (lymphoma), skin, or multiple areas of the body (Lymphoma Research Foundation, 2015). Around 20 million people worldwide are infected with HTLV. It is common in Japan, South and Central America, the Caribbean and Western Africa, and a large percentage (30) of African Americans are infected in certain areas of the US (e.g. New Jersey and New Orleans). It is transmitted through sexual contact or exposure to infected blood and blood products. Only a small percentage of carriers (5) actually come down with ATLL however, but there is no way to predict those that do. Survival depends on the ATLL subtype and var ies from 4-6 months to more than five years (Gonçalves, 2010). Treatment options include standard anti -cancer protocols but at present no therapy targets the virus. Other diseases and disorders from HTLV include the incapacitating neurological disease (HTL V-associated myelopathytropical spastic paraparesis HAMTSP), uveitis, rheumatic syndromes, and predisposition to helminth and bacterial infections (Gonçalves, 2010). As mentioned earlier, the compounds in this application may block other biological functions of Nedd4. For example, Nedd4 is overexpressed in a variety of cancers including bladder, breast, prostate, gastric carcinomas, colorectal, breast and non-small cell lung carcinomas and inhibits several tumor suppressor systems (e.g. PTEN, Beclin). Suppression of Nedd4 has been shown to reduce tumor cell growth (Boase, 2015; Wan, 2019, Ye, 2014; Zou 2015). Thus, these compounds could find applications in the treatment of such cancers. Nedd4 also negatively regulates interferon (IFN) -induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) that restricts cellular infection by influenza virus. Therefore, blocking Nedd4 could lead to therapeutic treatment of influenza (Chesarino, 2015) 3.2 Customers. As mentioned previously, BARDA is the most obvious customer for our RNA virus antiviral agent; however several potential governmental partners could provide development funds andor resources toward development including the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Office of Biodefens e Research (OBRA), Department of Defense (DOD), The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), The United Sates Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), Defense Science and Technology Laboratories (DSTL), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In addition to pursuing the government funding options outlined above, we may seek to partner with small biotechnology companies such as Siga, Tekmira, Chimerix, MappBio Pharm, Athene, Biocryst and Tetraphase, and large companies such as Merck, Johnson  Johnson, and GSK who currently are developing one or more therapeutics targeting a bioterrorism threat as most of these companies have a stated company goal of identifying and developing additional therapeutics in this area. 3.3 Competition. Since there are currently no other agents that inhibit virus egress that are being developed as broad spectrum RNA antiviral agents, an oral drug product based on FC -10696 is potentially a first-in -class treatment either as a mono-therapeutic prophylactic agent, or in combination with other agents currently in development for treatment of RNA viral infections. With respect to Ebola efforts, presently there are several therapeutics agents being evaluated that are summarized here. Commercialization Plan Page 129 Contact PDPI: Harty, Ronald N.  Recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus Zaire Ebola virus (rVSV-ZEBOV), sold under the brand name Ervebo (Merck) is a vaccine that prevents Zaire-strain Ebola. When used in ring vaccination, Ervebo has shown a high level of protection. Around half the people given the vaccine have mild to moderate adverse effects that include headache, fatigue, and muscle pain. Ervebo does not protect against other species of Ebolavirus or Marburg virus. Also, rural distribution has been a challenge and there is no data on longevity of the vaccines protection and how often an additional dose boost is required to extend immunity.  Johnson and Johnson is developing a vaccine regiment that consists of two doses leveraging different vaccines. One is the Ad26.ZEBOV monovalent vaccine based on adenovirus type 26 (Ad26) vector expressing the glycoprotein (GP) of the Ebola virus Mayinga variant (Ad26.ZEBOV). The other is multivalent Modified Vaccinia Virus Ankara (MVA) strain containing ZEBOV, SEBOV, Marburg Virus GP and Tai Forest nucleoprotein inserts (MVA-BN -Filo). More than 6,500 individuals have now participated in clinical studies for the Ebola vaccine across the U.S., Europe, and Africa. So far, the data from these studies suggest that the vaccine stimulates a robust immune response and has a favorable safety profile. Janssen has also assembled a stockpile of 1.5 million vaccine regimens for potential use in public health emergencies.  ZMapp (MappBio USA) is a cocktail of three monoclonal antibodies with neutralizing activity against Ebola virus in animal models. Phase II trial is underway. A similar produce MIL-77 (MabWorks, China) is undergoing Phase I study. A trial conducted in 71 patients, 36 of whom received ZMapp in addition to the standard of care, did not show a significant effect on mortality. At 28 days, death had occurred in 84 of 169 (49.7) of patients in the ZMapp group.  REGN-EB3 (Regeneron) is an experimental biopharmaceutical antiviral drug that is a cocktail of three monoclonal antibodies (REGN3470, 3471 and 3479) for treatment of Ebola virus disease. It is being developed, tested and manufactured as part of an agreement established in 2015 with BARDA, part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. REGN -EB3 is currently under clinical development and its safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority. It was developed against the Zaire species of Ebola virus, but the Sudan and Bundibugyo strains have also caused outbreaks and it is unlikely that EB3 would be effective against these strains. It was tested in the PALM trial that had enrolled nearly 700 participants across four Ebola Treatment Centers in the DRC. At 28 days, death occurred in 52 of 155 (33.5) patients in the REGN-EB3 group.  mAb114 is a monoclonal antibody (Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP) that is being evaluated as a treatment for Ebola virus disease. A license for mAb114 was obtained by in 2018 from the National Institutes of Health - National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. In the PALM trial that had enrolled nearly 700 participants across four Ebola Treatment Centers in the DRC. At 28 days, death occurred in 61 of 174 (35.1) patients in the MAb114 group.  Galidesivir (BCX4430, BioCryst) is a broad-spectrum small molecule antiviral in advanced development under the Animal Rule for the treatment of viruses including Ebola, Marburg, Yellow Fever and Zika viruses. A Phase 1 clinical safety and pharmacokinetics study in healthy subjects has been completed, and in animal studies, galidesivir has demonstrated survival benefits. Galidesivir is a viral RNA -dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor that has also demonstrated broad-spectrum activity in vitro against more than 20 ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses in nine different families, including filoviruses, togaviruses, bunyaviruses, arenaviruses, paramyxoviruses, coronaviruses and flaviviruses. Galidesivir may be suitable for administration by intravenous, intramuscular, and oral routes. There remains a critical need for additional agents, particularly with alternative modes of action. First many of the therapeutic agents above, particularly among the vaccine, antibody, siRNA andor antisense oligonucleotides are specific for individual viruses and sometimes only one or more strains within a virus. Biological agents require iv or infusion administration, and also need to be kept in the cold during storage, which are not ideal conditions in many remote areas of virus prevalence. Our product would be broad spectrum for RNA viruse s that have PPxY motifs. Our product differentiates further from vaccines in that it would be an oral agent with a great probability of more economic manufacturing and ease of distribution. Our agent could be Commercialization Plan Page 130 Contact PDPI: Harty, Ronald N. used in conjunction with other oral agents, like the cocktail\",\n",

An attending veterinarian is available at all time for emergencies. In the event that any aspect of this study causes more than normally expected brief pain or distress to the animals, the study director shall determine, in consultation with the attending veterinarian, if administration of appropriate sedatives, analgesics, or anesthetics, or other therapies would be contraindicated by the objectives of the study and document the resultant course of action. Animals that experience severe or chronic pain or distress that cannot be relieved will be euthanized. Point 4: Euthanasia Animals will typically be sacrificed after the last clinical o bservation noted or blood sample has been collected. All rats will be euthanized by cervical dislocation under isoflurane anesthesia. Isoflurane ensures that the rats are unconscious, while dislocation ensures quick death. This minimizes animal distress, i s effective, and efficient; it is consistent with the recommendations of the AVMA Guidelines on Euthanasia. Vertebrate Animals Page 171 Contact PDPI: Harty, Ronald N. VERTEBRATE ANIMALS SECTION (VAS) p. 1 of 1 1 2 3 4 Description of procedures In vivo pharmacokinetics (PK) assessment will be performed to determine the dose and dosing schedule for additional in vivo studies. PK work will be performed at Alliance Pharma (Malvern, PA), a CRO specializing in drug metabolism and PK (DMPK). C57Bl6 mice will be used. Justifications The proposed animal experiments are critical to determine PK parameters after intravenous (IV) and intratracheal (IT) drug administration, including half -life, peak plasma and lung tissue concentration (C max), and the integral of t he concentration -time curve in both plasma and lung tissue (AUC, a measure of drug exposure) to determine the dosing schedules to be used in future studies, and to enable an understanding of how drug exposure relates to efficacy in models of lung disease. To assess the PK profile of each compound, mice will be dosed IV andor IT with each compound, and plasma concentrations will be determined at up to eight time -points over 24 hours (n3 mice per time -point) using LC -MSMS. Total number of mice to be used for PK studies is 192 over a two year period. Minimization of Pain and Distress All p rocedures are designed to minimize discomfort and pain. Mice will be fed and watered appropriately throughout the entire protocol. Each cage also contains a nestlet for enrichment purposes. Levels of paindistress and endpoints are discussed by the IACUC as an integral part of the protocol review process. The IACUC ensures that the procedures described in the protocol are categorized appropriately. As an IACUC member, the Attending Veterinarian reviews all animal care and use protocols with an emphasis on those that require any anesthetics or analgesics. The AV and investigators discuss the appropriate selection and regimen for anesthetics and analge sics for the animal procedures in the protocol. The recommendations are then transferred into the protocol for IACUC review and approval. Euthanasia Any mice exhibiting pain or discomfort lasting longer than a few seconds that cannot be instantly relieved will be immediately euthanized. No animals are euthanized in the presence of their conspecifics (same room). Animals are placed in a clear, plexiglass chamber of known size and CO2 is introduced at a flow rate of 10 -30 (based on chamber size) via a calibrated flow meter. When animals are euthanized, death is assured by direct observation to ensure an absence of respiration. In addition, the chest is palpated to ensure an absence of a heartbeat. Methods of euthanasia used at Alliance are in compliance with the AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals: 2013 Edition.

We have one ABSL4 full -suit lab which is registered for CDC and USDA select agent work on human and animal pathogens. Access to the ABSL4 area is secured via three successive magnetic cardkeypad controlled airlock passages: The first is located at the entry foyer to the BSL3 suite, the second at the entry foyer to the outer changer room, and the third at the entry foyer to the ABSL4 area. The ABSL4 area is equipped with an entry and exit decontamination airlock and an emergency exitdecontamination chamber. The latter also serves as an equipment decontamination chamber to allow for the repair, removal andor replacement of faulty equipment without requiring a complete laboratory decontamination process. All supply and exhaust air for the ABSL4 passes through dual (and tandem) HEPA filters. The laboratory contains 3 x class IIB biological safety hoods, 4 x water-jacketed CO2 incubators, low -, high- and ultra-speed centrifuges equipped with both analytical and preparative scale rotors, a microfuge, 2 x 4C refrigerators, 2 x liquid nitrogen storage systems, and 3 x -80 C freezers. The ABSL4 also has 2 CytoSMART Lux systems, an optical ELISA plate reader, MAGPIX multiplexing 96-well format unit, luminometer, Innova 4000 environmental shaker, microplate shaker, BioFlo III fermenters with chillers, Evos fluorescent microscope, pass - through autoclave, dunk tank, facsimile machine and networked computers. Housing for animals in the ABSL4 space includes 2 rodent racks able to accommodate 36 cages for guinea pigs or up to 480 mice. Non-human primate (NHP) housing consists of squeeze back cages to house up to 12 marmosets and 24 macaques which are placed within a microisolated enclosure. Vetscan and Procyte hematology and blood chemistry Abaxis analyzers are available in the space for analysis of blood collected from infected animals. Coagulation parameters can be measured in the lab with Idexx analyzers. Specialized equipment for monitoring biopotentials of NHPs in the ABSL4 includes the DSI (Data Science International) Telemetry System with analysis software. A dedicated procedure area is located within the lab to perform routine animal sampling and full necropsies. Critical parameters (air supply and exhaust flow rates, pressure differentials, normal and emergency breathing air, decontamination systems, etc.) are continuously monitored. Personnel within the lab communicate, and are actively monitored by outside personnel, through a scrambled UHF communication system worn inside the laboratory suit. The 500 sq. ft. ABSL4 laboratory staging area includes an air locked suit change room, two inner change rooms with pass -through showers, and an outer clean change room equipped with sinks, Select Agent Research Page 173 Contact PDPI: Harty, Ronald N. lockers, toilets, etc. Critical mechanical support devices are located in an attached 3,000 sq. ft. mechanical support complex. All critical equipment and devices (valves, etc.) are redundant, including duplicate air-supply and exhaust systems, decontamination shower systems, as well as the compressors, pumps, valves, heater cores, etc. that comprise the liquid waste decontamination system. All critical mechanical devices operate on a system with automatic emergency electricity backup generators. The ABSL4 area (including mechanical support rooms) is equipped with an elaborate intrusion detection system that includes electronic door and roof hatch sensors, motion detectors, etc. Texas Biomed maintains an experienced and trained staff of scientists, veterinarians, research technicians and veterinary technicians available to perform studies at high biocontainment. These individuals have demonstrated proficiency at conducting in vitro and animal studies with the agent identified in the proposal. The ABSL4 Operations and Safety Manuals specify policies, procedures, and standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the safe handling of biological materials in biosafety laboratories. The policies, procedures, and SOPs comply with applicable Federal, State, and municipal regulations and with the guidelines Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories issued by the CDC and the National Institute of Health (NIH). Employees are trained from these manuals on each facility mechanical systems, biosafety, biocontainment and security. Employees are also trained according to project specific and Departmental SOPs. These procedures apply to all that use, generate, store, or dispose of potentially infectious materials in Texas Biomed biosafety laboratories and to persons who must enter these laboratories to perform services. Select agent use, transfer or possession is forbidden without the permission of the Responsible Official (RO) and until the required forms filed and written approval received from the CDC Select Agent Program. Upon approval, ABSL4 investigators desiring to work on a BSL4 project must also submit an application to the Biohazard and Safety Committee for approval. The Committee is responsible for evaluating the facility, equipment, and staff capabilities to perform work in a safe manner. Infectious cultures and inventory stocks are stored inside the ABSL4 laboratory in locked refrigerators and freezers. An electronic Inventory (eInventory) system is used to document usage of infectious stocks. All infectious material stored in refrigerators or freezers is properly labeled and stored in containers capable of withstanding thermal shock of freezing and thawing. Each container is labeled with the identity of the infectious agent, the date of the preparation, and a barcode that links the material to the more inclusive information contained in the inventory database. When work is completed, all infectious cultures are removed from workbenches and cabinets and stored in a designated refrigerator or freezer. Materials to be discarded are placed in a sealable container filled with a suitable disinfectant. The container is placed in a discard pan containing the disinfectant. Discard pans are placed on a cart and transported to the autoclave. Labware containing infectious liquids are stored and transported in leak -proof containers large enough to contain the fluid in case of leakage.

FCCDC has the capacity to prepare up to 250 g of any chemical analog. We will scale up, in multigram amounts, analogs that meet the criteria on the flow scheme for in vivo or other non - GLP assays . In addition, we will synthesize possible metabolites found during the metabolite identification processes. Our mandate is to improve aqueous solubility of our analogs while continuing to improve their potency, therapeutic index, ADME, PK and safety properties. We will focus on the following four areas: 1) Understand stereospecificity of FC -10696. Of our three lead compounds, FC -10696 has the best microsomal stability and solubility. Thus, we will synthesize both R and S enantiomers from the readily available starting materials S and R 1-1,1-biphenyl-4-ylethanol, respectively. These will be evaluated for potency, stability and solubility to determine the most promising enantiomer for further studies. We will also determine IV and PO PK in mice of the best enantiomer to determine if it could be an early front runner in our pursuit of a preclinical candidate. 2) Quarternary methylene analogs of FC -10696. Analogs C and or D in Fig. 9 avoid the chiral center of FC - 10696 altogether and we expect good potency in our primary assays based on previous SAR, as well as good stability in mouse microsomes. Our previous method of preparing compounds of this type utilized 4-(1 -bromo-1 - methyl -ethyl)-biphenyl to alkylate a quinoxaline thiol and led to FC -12004 in Table 1 among others, which gave poor yields of desired products ( 5).

        "      \"Ebola Situation Report 2015). More recently the Democratic Republic of the Congo has second largest Ebola epidemic on record, which is ongoing, and as of June, 2020, with more than 2,200 lives lost, 3,400 confirmed infections and 1,160 survivors since the outbreak was declared on 1 August 2018. These unprecedented epidemics have spurred a call to action to discover new, cost effect therapies that combat this deadly pathogen. Among these efforts are several vaccines and antiviral drug candidates. However, the current vaccines are not a complete defense since they must be given pre-exposure. Oral antiviral agents used alone or in combination may be of value for individuals who respond adversely to the vaccine, and could be of value as prophylactic agents for individuals deemed to be in high risk situations such as military or healthcare workers. Therefore, effective therapeutics are needed to safeguard the largely immunologically naive human population by providing immediate protection. We have discovered two novel series of small molecule early leads that have nanomolar potency at inhibiting RNA virus budding and are Commercialization Plan Page 123 Contact PDPI: Harty, Ronald N. effective at reducing spread of live viruses including Marburg and Ebola virus. We are currently pursuing both series in order to increase our chance of success. Our most advanced lead is compound, FC -10696 and close structural analogs have the following attributes, tested to the extent afforded by the Phase I level of funding:  Potent activity (IC 50  100 nM) in the Marburg and Ebola VLP cellular budding (egress) assays,  Evidence that analogs of FC -10696 directly target the host cell and virus molecular machinery that effect viral cellular egress,  Live virus activity against RNA viruses (Marburg, Ebola),  Metabolic stability in mouse and human liver microsomes,  No cytochrome P450 3A4 activity which translates to a lower risk of drug- drug interactions,  Good drug levels upon IP administration in mice, and  Proof of concept in vivo reductions of Marburg virus (IP administration) in mouse models. However, it is important to note that improved analogs and additional novel composition of matter are expected to be discovered during the course of the Phase II STTR period of study, with fully characterized ADME properties suitable as antiviral oral drug candidates for preclinical development. 1.2 Expected outcomes: path to commercialization including timelines. The goal of this STTR Phase II application is to produce one or more preclinical drug candidates by medicinal chemistry synthesis optimization strategies that would be ready for GMP scale up and IND enabling studies. At the end of this award period we would have one or more drug candidates that are:  Potent, orally available inhibitors of RNA virus egress, due to inhibition of the viral matrix protein PPxY interaction with cellular Nedd4,  Broad spectrum activity agains t RNA viruses (Ebola, Marburg, Ebola, Lassa, RSV, etc).  Are not cytotoxic at concentrations 20-fold or higher than the live virus assay IC50,  Have suitable ADME and PK properties in mice for once a day oral administration,  Have oral activity in a mouse antiviral assay,  Have little or no cytochrome P450 inhibitory (Cyp) activity against the seven Cyp isoforms most likely to cause exposure variability and drug- drug interactions (DDIs),  Have little or no activity in a manual patch clamp assay to assess hERG (human Ether-à-go-go-Related Gene product), suggesting a greatly lower risk of the compound causing cardiac arrhythmias,  Have little or no activity in an Ames testing with and without metabolic activation, suggesting a greatly lower risk of the compound being mutagenic,  Have chemical syntheses that are efficient and scalable, and  Provide the basis for one or more composition of matter U.S. patent applications. We anticipate being in an ideal position to pursue IND enabling studies with our candidate compound and will require additional funding to support IND filing and early clinical development. Many of the future IND -enabling activities would be funded from sources listed later in this application. Such post -Phase II SBIR activities include:  Preparation of 300 g of non-GMP active pharmaceutical agent,  Selection of a suitable salt form (if necessary), vehicle and formulation, and evaluation of crystallinity and the propensity for polymorph formation,  Analytical methods development,  Drug substance stability testing, including standard pharmaceutics development work -up involving shelf- life and stress testing,  File additional provisional and PCT patent applications as necessary, and  Prepare 5 kg of GMP quality active pharmaceutical ingredient.

My postdoctoral fellowship and subsequent two year federal employment was in The Molecular Interfaces and Tribology Section of the Department of Chemistry, Naval Research Laboratory. This section studies interdisciplinary questions in basic and applied interface and surface science. Our groups research stretched from advancing broad analytical methods, such as vibrational circular dichroism, to evaluating both prototypical and realistic interfaces to crafting and improving molecular surfaces and peptide architectures for applications such as controlling biological activity, anti -fouling, or lowering contact friction. One focus area was in the design and employment of bioinspired materials that conserve and utilize the exceptional characteristics of biomaterials while combining added functionality, such as fluorescence or conductivity, not originating from natural materials.

The beginning of my computational chemistry career began when I was using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to determine the structures of biological macromolecules like peptides, polypeptides, and proteins. To do this, I would rely on 1D, homo- and hetero-nuclear 2D, and triple resonance, 3D, spectra. Some other examples of this work are cited in scientific contribution 3, above. After extracting all available information about the atomic distances and torsion angles from the NMR spectra, computer -aided structure calculations would convert distance and torsion angle data (constraints) into the 3D atomic model. For these calculations, a molecular dynamics simulation was used with simulated annealing; increasing temperature to generate an ensemble of conformations then decreasing temperature with increasing constraints based on the NMR data. The result is a family of structures that span a relatively narrow conformational space (low RMSD), unless intrinsically flexible, and obeys the constraint cri teria.

Indirect Cost and Fee Indirect costs of 40 are requested. A fee of 7 is requested. Justification for budget above statutory budget limitations According to National Institutes of Health SBA -Approved SBIRSTTR Topics for Awards over Statutory Budget Limitations as listed in Appendix A of the omnibus 2020 solicitation (https:sbir.nih.govsitesdefaultfilesNIH_Topics_for_Budget_Waivers.pdf), the topic discovery and development of therapeutics for infectious diseases (the prime concern of this proposal) is listed in NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Disease (DMD) as eligible for budgets over the statutory maximum amounts. Small molecule drug discovery is very expensive and labor intensive, involving the synthesis and evaluation of a large number of test compounds in an iterative fashion. In this STTR Phase II grant application, we embark on a full lead optimization program with the goal of obtaining preclinical drug candidates for the treatment of Marburg, Ebola and related viral infections. Our current lead series are novel and suitable for composition of matter patent protection, and a US patent has issued on the original series which will be supplemented by additional provisional patent applications over time. We expect the optimized compounds at the end of Phase II to have increased potency, and be safe and suitable for oral administration.

The Cohen- Eisen berg labs have crystallized and solved the structures of each of the entry proteins and the cell receptors , so that epitopes may be mapped onto the 3 -D structures of the proteins. In this phase I project, we will focus on the gD glycoprotein, for which the Cohen- Eisenberg labs have developed a large library of antibodies against both type I and type II HSV (Figure A.1). In addition to generally gaining a broader and deeper understanding of the binding patterns in these antibodies and other variants as much still remains uncharacterized in the library (especially specific epitopes), we will study an intriguing question about antigen diversity raised by a recent vaccine trial. GlaxoSmithKline developed a vaccine using gD from type II HSV; unfortunately the vaccine only provided protection against Type II HSV for 35 of the study participants , but surprisingly it provided o ver 80 protection against Type I HSV15. Studying the large -scale impacts of antigenic variability on antibody recognition will be made possible by the proposed approaches. Moreover, this work stands uniquely at the intersection between basic studies of recognition and immune responses to glycoproteins responsible for virus entry. Strength of the premise. The importance of characterizing antibody:antigen binding, particularly localizing epitopes, has been well established 5,7,11. Due to the time and expense of structure determination discussed above6,12, a variety of other methods have been developed, but they do not provide both the throughput and resolution of the proposed approach. For example H -D exchange mass spectrometry is still relatively low throughput6,12, while peptide arrays do not use native antigenic structures6,12. In addition, a lanine scanning is laborious and of a low hit rate16, while at the other extreme shotgun mutagenesis provides a lot of data but not of the same resolution and quality as SPR and due to random variation so literally hit -or-miss while not capturing impacts due to natural variation17. Purely computational approaches for antibody epitope prediction are not yet of sufficient accuracy to be generally useful18,19, though the steady improvement in antibody modeling and docking2027 provides some hope particularly for antibody -specific approaches, especially when integrated with experimental data 28 as we propose to do here. In particular, the proposed approach builds upon the well -established Wasatch SPR platform, for multiplexed evaluation of a matrix of either antibody:antigen binding or antibody:antibody competition for a single antigen. The latter approach is commonly termed  binning, as antibodies possessing similar blocking profiles are placed in the same bin 7. It is now commonly being conducted at the earliest possible stages in drug discovery 7,1012; e.g., Yasmina Abidche recently detailed how epitope binning using instrument packages from Wasatch and ForteBio is improving Pfizer -Rinats drug discovery processes29. Thus our proposed method builds upon this strong technological platform in order to address a significant gap in large- scale, rapid, detailed characterization of antibody:antigen binding. B. Innovation Researchers from both the vaccine community and the antibody therapeutic community need better, faster, and more scalable techniques to characterize antibody epitopes, across entire arrays of antibodies and antigenic variants. Since neither purely computational nor purely experimental techniques meet these goals, our innovative integrated methodology promises to combine the best characteristics of each side. The high - throughput, multiplexed analysis of antibody:antigen binding promises to fill pipelines with epitopically diverse candidates, inherently leading to more functional diversity and increased odds of success at the clinical stage.7 Specific innovations of our proposed approach include the following:  Integration of computational docking with large- scale antibody:antigen binding studies. Computational methods alone are not yet sufficient to localize epitopes and binding mechanisms, and neither are binding studies alone, but the integration of these techniques promises to provide complementary insights enabling modeling of the binding.  Computational design of sets of mutations to test specific binding hypotheses. In contrast to alanine scanning, single point mutation, and site saturation, our methods will design mutations based on prior knowledge and modeling, so as to best (most efficiently and confidently) evaluate putative binding modes.  Exploitation of natural and artificial antigenic variability . In order to localize epitopes, our methods will analyze the relationship between sequence differences and binding differences, inferring which sets of residues are likely to play key roles. Contact PDPI: Brooks, Benjamin Delbert Research Strategy Page 67  Systematic analysis of antibody competition assays across multiple antigens . While antibody competition with respect to a single antigen has become a standard approach, our approach will combine competition results across multiple variants to better characterize communities.  Development of reference panels . Our computational methods will select among natural variants and design new ones, so as to best support both coarse and fine grained epitope localization.  Computational analysis methods for large- scale antibody competition and binding studies . Our platform breaks new ground in characterizing antibody:antig en binding by integrated analysis of the large - scale data provided by the Wasatch SPR. C. Approach We will pursue two complementary approaches for the systematic characterization of antibody:antigen binding, requiring different experimental effort and yielding representations of different generality and specificity (Fig. C. 1). An antibody vs. antibody binning experiment (Fig. C.1, top) evaluates competition between antibodies in binding an antigen, and can thereby reveal which antibodies are likely to be recognizing overlapping regions on the antigen. Thus competition results from a large binning experiment, as Wasatch SPR can produce, are naturally represented in terms of communities of antibodies that tend to compete with each other. In our preliminary results below, we showed that binning identified communities consistent with previous low -throughput experiments conducted over many years, and that binning across antigenic variants resulted provided important information about the epitopic landscape of the protein, has been traditional ly been much more difficult to obtain. In our proposed work, we will extend from using binning only to identify antibody communities to also simultaneously character ize their rough footprints on the antigen. Consider a hypothetical scenario where two antigenic variants differ by only one amino acid, and the antibodies in a community bind one variant but not the other. Intuitively, we can infer that the variable amino acid is likely to be important for the binding of those antibodies. This intui tion also drives the popular but limited alanine scanning approach to epitope16, more focused site-directed mutagenesis methods17,30 as well literally hit -or- miss approaches like shotgun mutagenesis16. Our proposed approach will exploit this insight in the more natural scenario, which is also generally more helpful, where there are multiple antigen variants and each pair of antigens differs at multiple positions (Fig. C.2) . An antibody vs. antigen binding experiment (Fig. C.1, bottom) Figure C.1 . Cartoon intuition for the approaches. (top, aim 1) Binning- based inference of antibody communities and general epitope localization. Each matrix captures binning results between each pair of antibodies (rows and columns) competing to bind a single antigen; red indicates high competition, yellow medium, green low, and gray indeterminate. The data enable the inference of antibody communities from mutual competition, as well as general regions on the antigen reco gnized by each community from competition differences with respect to antigenic sequence variation. (bottom, aim 2 ) Binding -based inference of fine epitope localization. The single matrix represents binding between each antibody:antigen pair (antibodies as rows, antigenic variants as columns), with a quantitative binding measurement indicated in grayscale. Once again, the impact of antigenic sequence variation on the experimental results enables localization of antibody binding, but here at a finer resolution due to the larger extent of antigenic variability and the incorporation of additional antibody and antigen structural modeling.

Contact PDPI: Brooks, Benjamin Delbert Research Strategy Page 68 evaluates the strength of a particular interaction; Wasatch SPR can do this in parallel for a whole matrix of pairs of antibodies and antigens. In our preliminary results below, we show that the SPR instrument readily enables identification of linear epitopes via antibody:peptide binding. In our proposed work, we will more precisely localize the hotspots mediating antibody:antigen recognition, with respect to native antigen conformations rather than individual peptides , and we will scale up to whole panels of antibodies . As de scribed intuitively above, impacts of antigenic variation on antibody binding enables inference of residues important for recognition. Here, in characterizing the epitope of a particular antibody, we will have a richer set of variants enabling finer grained localization. Our proposed approach will leverage this data with and without reference to predictions of putative binding modes by computational docking methods. Furthermore, we will assess the augmentation of preexisting natural antigenic variants with new ones that have been computationally designed to be informative in revealing epitopes. Overall, the contrast in the two approaches is that our binning method will generalize across antibodies, providing coarse localization information such that, assuming we have a sufficiently comprehensive panel, new antibodies are likely to fall into the same communities with the same interaction patterns. On the other hand, our mapping method will finely localize a specific interaction in a way that captures details of particular antibody:antigen pairs. In both cases, we leverage and assess the impact of antigenic variability, though using more extensive variability (at consequently more expense) for binding than for binning. In the binding case, we also consider use of antibody sequence (again, at more expense) and computationally hypothesized binding modes, and target the design of artificial antigenic variants to provide further information. Aim 1. Define communities of antibodies with similar antigen binding patterns. Preliminary Data. A preliminary epitope binning study was perfor med by Wasatch and the Cohe nEisenberg teams to evaluate the effectiveness of the high-throughput system for characterizing epitopes of a library of mAbs with multiple variants of an antigen. The results set the stage for this Phase I SBIR project. The study assessed four different gD constructs (truncations of length 285 and 306, for both type I and type 2 Figure C.3. Antibody community maps from four gD variants. A community plot is a network plot (e.g. social networks) generated from the epitope binning heat maps. The different colors represent 4 Wasatch derived unique communities formed by the binning characteristic s of 40 different gD monoclonal antibodies obtained from 6 different laboratories. Circles represent binding in both directions (surface attached and in solution) whereas squares represent binding only in one direct. Chord length indicates degree of relate dness s defined by relative completion in the binning assay. Dashed chord indicate that there is asymmetry in the relationship (i.e. blocking does not reciprocate). Figure C.4.

The colors on the 3 -D structures represent the presumed location of two major epitopes IA and IB (pink and red) derived by genetic and mutagenic analysis. The C -termin us shown in black, lies along the intersection of IA and IB and also intersects the Nectin -1 receptor binding site. The N -terminus (shown in yellow) is presented to show the complexity of the Nectin -1 binding face. Contact PDPI: Brooks, Benjamin Delbert Research Strategy Page 69 HSV). The classical sandwich binning assay format was used, with antibody competition used to identify pairs of antibodies with overlapping HSV epitopes via Wasatchs CFM and Ibis MX96 surface plasmon resonance imager (SPRi) biosensor. Communities of co -competing antibodies were then identified, separately for each antigen (Figure C.3) which shows how the four general binding communities are related for each mutant . While the communities are generally the same between type 1 and 2 for gD 285, important structural differences in the proteins are exposed in gD 306 between type 1 and 2 two as shown in the differences between the community maps. Importantly, these differ ences in communities relate to important structural and epitope details that had been identified by previous low -throughput methods (Figure C.4). Proposed Work: Experimental. The CohenEisenberg Labs at the University of Pennsylvania has available multiple gD variants and multiple antibodies (Fig. A,1). These constructs as well as constructs obtained from Integral Molecular (see letters of support) will be used to conduct a set of epitope binning experiment s for up to 60 selected antibodies across at least 10 gD variants , to feed into the computational analysis . Proposed Work: Computational . Our goal is to find communities of related antibodies and corresponding regions on the antigen that mediate their binding. We will focus on the case where antibody communities are already defined by binning as in our preliminary results, since we have shown that that method yields communities consistent with external characterizations of related antibodies. But now we will have communities identified for multiple different antigenic variant s, with amino acid differences in the antigen leading to perturbations in binding (see again Fig. C.3) and thereby the competition results and identified antibody clusters. Under the assumption that antibodies in a community recognize nearby residues in the antigens structure (since they compete for binding to the antigen), those residues should be spatially proximal on the antigenic surface. Thus the approach is to cluster, with respect to the antigenic surface, the variable residues that perturb a community. We will implement and assess standard clustering techniques (hierarchical, k-means, etc.), with custom metrics that account for a combination of residue proximity on the surface and\",\n",

The significance of the proposed work is exceptionally high as effective therapies for emerging human RNA viruses are urgently needed. The Phase I portion of the project was very successful and yielded a lead series with promising properties, including in vivo proof-of-concept. There is a solid foundation for further optimization of drug-like properties and demonstration of in vivo efficacy. The overall approach is well-conceived, logically presented and sufficiently detailed; supplemental information shows that the lead molecule also blocks release of live infectious SARS-CoV-2 from infected human lung cells, which is consistent with the mechanism of action. Few minor weaknesses associated with the unclear ‘new’ scaffolds do not detract from the very high enthusiasm the panel expressed for this comprehensive and likely impactful proposal.\"\n",

These are also rare diseases, and the investigators can benefit from that designation along with being eligible for the US neglected disease voucher program. The scientific rigor from the data obtained from the Phase I study is strong with the identification of two lead series of compounds and an advanced lead compound with very good potency. The strategy to block the viral-host interactions between the matrix protein PPxY and select host proteins for efficient virus egress (cellular budding) and spreading infection appears innovative. The strong premise of the project plan with the potential to identify a preclinical candidate that could lead to acute toxicity study phase of the pre-IND. The details of a screening cascade, target product profile and go no-go decisions, and a robust commercialization plan with options, provide confidence that this well rounded team can execute the current objectives and has the high potential to nominate a clinical candidate from this project. The resources lined up and the facilities that will be used to conduct the proposed studies and the strength of a world class team assembled around this project has made this a highly impactful proposal.\",\n",

There are no commercially available small molecule therapeutics for these viral infections. The proposed anti-virals will fill a significant unmet need. The team has discovered several chemical series that block the host Nedd4/virus PPxY complex (critical regulator of viral transmission) and have identified an analog capable of blocking in vivo activity in a Marburg virus challenged mouse model as proof of concept. In the current proposal they will use their current lead inhibitor series, (e.g., FC-10696) to generate novel candidates for IND-enablement studies. To accomplish this goal, 2 R42 AI138630-03 6 ZRG1 BCMB-G (10) HARTY, R scientists at the Fox Chase Chemical Diversity Center, Inc. (FCCDC; pharmaceutical and medicinal chemistry), the Harty Lab at the University of Pennsylvania (experimental aspects of antiviral therapy), and the lab of Olena Shtanko at Texas Biomedical Research Institute (evaluating compounds against live viruses in vitro and in vivo under BSL-4 conditions) have combined their considerable experience and expertise. The team of researchers has extensive expertise in relevant areas and are a major strength. Preliminary data provided in the proposal indicate that the approach is promising and newly designed leads exhibit antiviral activity. The overall approach is well conceived, is based on solid literature precedent, and addresses the major aspects required of a drug discovery program. In addition, supplements (Additional Materials) recently submitted by the PI suggest the compounds under development may have the potential to serve as broad-spectrum antivirals against emerging pathogens (e.g., SARS-Co-V-2). There is considerable enthusiasm for the project with only minor concerns.\",\n",
